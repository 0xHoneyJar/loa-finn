The system architecture spans multiple layers of abstraction. The persistence
layer handles write-ahead logging and crash recovery. The gateway layer manages
authentication and request routing. The scheduler coordinates background tasks
across worker threads. The compound module orchestrates multi-step operations.
Cross-referencing the implementation reveals the integration points at
`src/persistence/wal.ts:42` and `src/gateway/auth.ts:10` and `src/scheduler/cron.ts:15`.
