# Sprint Completion Lifecycle

## Overview

Sprint completion follows a strict implement → review → audit → complete pipeline. Each gate must pass before the next can execute. The `COMPLETED` marker file is the authoritative signal that a sprint has cleared all quality gates.

## State Transitions

```

                         Back to IMPLEMENT
```

## COMPLETED Marker

**File**: `grimoires/loa/a2a/sprint-N/COMPLETED`

**Created by**: The `audit-sprint` skill (`skills/auditing-security/`) upon APPROVED verdict.

**Detection**: `golden-path.sh` checks for this marker via:

```bash
_gp_sprint_is_complete() {
    local sprint_id="$1"
    local sprint_dir="${_GP_A2A_DIR}/${sprint_id}"
    [[ -f "${sprint_dir}/COMPLETED" ]]
}
```

## Detection Functions

### `golden_detect_sprint()`

Finds the first incomplete sprint by iterating sprint-1 through sprint-N:

```
for each sprint-N:
  if COMPLETED marker missing → return "sprint-N"
if all complete → return ""
```

### `golden_detect_review_target()`

Finds the first sprint needing review:

```
for each sprint-N:
  skip if COMPLETED
  if sprint dir exists (work started) → return "sprint-N"
return ""
```

### `_gp_sprint_is_reviewed()`

A sprint is considered reviewed if:
1. It has already been audited (audit implies review passed), OR
2. `engineer-feedback.md` exists AND contains no "Changes Required", "Findings", or "Issues" sections

When `engineer-feedback.md` carries a `<!-- LOA-VERDICT {...} -->` trailer — detected loosely: any HTML comment reading `LOA…VERDICT` with whitespace or hyphen variants counts as a trailer and is sent to `verdict-derive.sh`, which accepts only the exact `<!-- LOA-VERDICT {json} -->` form and fails closed on anything else; the prose heuristic applies only to files with no such marker at all — the trailer path replaces rule 2: `_gp_verdict_gate` runs `verdict-derive.sh --gate review --json` and passes only when it exits 0, `.consistent` is `true` and `.verdict` is `APPROVED`. The gate fails closed — an inconsistent or unparseable trailer, any non-zero exit, or a missing `jq` all read as "not reviewed"; the prose heuristic applies only to files with no trailer at all.

### `_gp_sprint_is_audited()`

A sprint is audited if `auditor-sprint-feedback.md` exists and contains "APPROVED".

With a trailer, the same fail-closed gate runs with `--gate audit`; additionally (a) when `engineer-feedback.md` carries a trailer it is re-derived with `--gate review` and must be APPROVED (an audit implies review), (b) when the review trailer carries `excluded > 0`, the audit trailer's `excluded_confirmed` must equal it (absent reads as 0; a non-integer or a value longer than six digits denies).

## A2A Directory Structure

```
grimoires/loa/a2a/sprint-N/
├── engineer-feedback.md        # /review-sprint output
├── auditor-sprint-feedback.md  # /audit-sprint output
├── COMPLETED                   # Marker file (created on audit approval)
└── ... (other sprint artifacts)
```

## Ledger Integration

When a Sprint Ledger exists (`grimoires/loa/ledger.json`):

- Local sprint IDs (sprint-1, sprint-2) map to global IDs via the ledger
- `/implement`, `/review-sprint`, and `/audit-sprint` all resolve local → global IDs
- The `COMPLETED` marker uses the local sprint directory structure
- Ledger sprint entries track status independently (but should be consistent)

## Run Mode Integration

In `/run sprint-plan`, the completion lifecycle runs autonomously:

1. `/implement sprint-N` executes tasks
2. `/review-sprint sprint-N` validates implementation
3. `/audit-sprint sprint-N` performs security audit
4. If audit APPROVED → COMPLETED marker created → next sprint
5. If audit/review fails → cycle back to implement (circuit breaker limits retries)
