  "summary": "The two iteration-2 blockers (PATH_SAFETY ordering and stale CONTENT_MATCH references) are corrected in a way that preserves the deterministic verifier/repair-loop contract, and no new truly blocking issues were introduced.",

    {
      "original_issue": "Citation path traversal / unsafe file reads due to PATH_SAFETY being described as 'before any file read' but ordered after LINE_RANGE in the enumerated steps",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "§3.3.1 now explicitly places PATH_SAFETY as step 2 immediately after EXTRACT and before FILE_EXISTS/LINE_RANGE, and it states that downstream steps operate only on the normalized repo-relative path returned by PATH_SAFETY (raw extracted paths never reach sed/cat). This resolves the security-boundary inconsistency that could otherwise allow unintended file reads."

    {
      "original_issue": "Repair loop and circuit breaker examples referenced removed CONTENT_MATCH/expected_identifier instead of the new evidence-anchor contract",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "§5.3 failure schema now uses check: \"EVIDENCE_ANCHOR\" and includes the specific missing anchor token plus context, and §8.2 circuit breaker example likewise references EVIDENCE_ANCHOR. This aligns the convergence mechanism with the current deterministic verification contract."
