# Implementation Report — sprint-bug-245 (bug 20260924-57bc88, bead `bd-ypbg`)

**Sprint**: sprint-bug-245 — the cost-budget enforcer halts permanently on historical unpriced ledger rows
**Branch**: `fix/cycle-125-followups` (from `main` `5f4a58a5`, `v2.0.0-rc.2`)
**Triage**: `grimoires/loa/a2a/bug-20260924-57bc88/triage.md` · **Plan**: `grimoires/loa/a2a/bug-20260924-57bc88/sprint.md`

## Executive Summary

The FR-5 guard (`halt-uncertainty: unpriced_share`) compared the ledger's *all-time* unpriced share against 5 %, so a repository whose ledger carried rows written before the pricing ladder (this one: 37 of 54, `openai/codex-headless`, `pricing_source: unknown`, cost 0) could never be certified `allow` again, for any day. Two root-cause fixes, test-first:

1. **The guard measures the day it certifies.** `cost-report.sh --json --window-day <YYYY-MM-DD>` adds a `window {day, entry_count, unpriced_rows, unpriced_share}` object next to the unchanged all-time fields; `_l2_unpriced_share_json <utc_day>` asks for the verdict's day, compares the window share (an unpriced row inside the window still halts), falls back to the all-time share when the report has no window (older shape — conservative), and carries `unpriced_window` in the allow payload and `window_day` / `unpriced_share_all_time` / `unpriced_rows_all_time` in the halt diagnostic. Payload schemas extended additively.
2. **History is re-priced only explicitly.** New `loa_cheval.metering.reprice` (`is_unpriced`, `reprice_row`, `reprice_rows`) prices an unpriced row exactly as `create_ledger_entry` would price a fresh row with the same tokens (ladder + `calculate_total_cost`) and marks it (`repriced_at`, `repriced_from`, `cost_estimated: true`, `pricing_resolution`, `resolved_model`); `cost-report.sh --reprice [--dry-run]` drives it — symlinked ledger refused, priced/unresolvable rows and corrupt lines kept byte-for-byte, byte copy to `<ledger>.pre-reprice-<UTC>`, atomic replace, receipt `.run/cost-ledger-reprice-<UTC>[-N].json` (counts and sha256s, never row contents), idempotent (a second run re-prices 0, makes no backup, still leaves a receipt). No new configuration key.

Red → green: UP-6/UP-7/UP-9 (enforcer), CR-6/CR-7 (report) and the seven `test_reprice_rows.py` cases failed on the pre-fix tree (`scratchpad/bug245-red.tap`: `not ok 6, 7, 9, 17, 18`; pytest "1 error during collection") and pass now; UP-8 is a regression guard for the conservative fallback (passes before and after by design).

## AC Verification (sprint.md)

### Bug is no longer reproducible: on a copy of this repository's ledger the verdict for a day without unpriced rows is `allow`; a day with unpriced rows above 5 % still halts; `--reprice` on the copy re-prices the 37 `codex-headless` rows through the hop with marks and a receipt, and a second run re-prices 0
- **Status**: ✓ Met
- **Evidence**: E2E on `scratchpad/ledger-copy.jsonl` (a byte copy; the repository ledger's sha256 was identical afterwards): `cost-report.sh --json --window-day 2026-09-24` → `entry_count 54, unpriced_rows 37, unpriced_share 0.685185, window {day 2026-09-24, entry_count 0, unpriced_rows 0, unpriced_share 0}`; production-path `budget_verdict 5.00` (no bats marker, `LOA_COST_LEDGER_PATH` = the copy) → `verdict allow, unpriced_share 0.0, unpriced_window 2026-09-24`; the same with `LOA_BUDGET_TEST_NOW=2026-09-22T12:00Z` → `halt-uncertainty / unpriced_share`, diagnostic `unpriced_share 0.724138, unpriced_rows 21, window_day 2026-09-22, unpriced_share_all_time 0.685185` (the day that holds the unpriced rows still halts); `--reprice --dry-run` → "37 of 37 unpriced row(s) would be re-priced"; `--reprice` → "re-priced 37 of 37 … (0 still unpriced)", report `unpriced_rows 0, repriced_rows 37, estimated_rows 37, pricing_resolution {hop 41, cli_reported 13}`, receipt `scratchpad/e2e-run/cost-ledger-reprice-20260924T013108Z.json`; a second `--reprice --dry-run` → "0 of 0". Code: `.claude/scripts/lib/cost-budget-enforcer-lib.sh:1237` (the guard passes `$utc_day`), `.claude/scripts/lib/cost-budget-enforcer-lib.sh:1299` (window share with all-time fallback), `.claude/scripts/cost-report.sh:562` (the `window` object), `.claude/scripts/cost-report.sh:271` (the `--reprice` pass), `.claude/adapters/loa_cheval/metering/reprice.py:54` (`reprice_row`).

### Failing test proves the fix
- **Status**: ✓ Met
- **Evidence**: red record `scratchpad/bug245-red.tap` — `not ok 6` UP-6, `not ok 7` UP-7, `not ok 9` UP-9, `not ok 17` CR-6, `not ok 18` CR-7; `pytest tests/test_reprice_rows.py` → "Interrupted: 1 error during collection" (no `loa_cheval.metering.reprice`). Green record `scratchpad/bug245-green.tap` — `1..18`, 18 ok; pytest 7 passed. Cases: `tests/unit/cost-budget-enforcer-unpriced.bats:95` (UP-6 clean window → allow with `unpriced_window`), `tests/unit/cost-budget-enforcer-unpriced.bats:107` (UP-7 unpriced row inside the window still halts, `window_day` + `unpriced_share_all_time` in the diagnostic), `tests/unit/cost-budget-enforcer-unpriced.bats:121` (UP-8 no window → all-time fallback), `tests/unit/cost-budget-enforcer-unpriced.bats:132` (UP-9 argv `--json --window-day 2026-05-04` through the bats-gated stub seam; without the marker the stub is ignored and the real report answers with `window_day`), `tests/unit/cost-report.bats:126` (CR-6 window object for three days + markdown line + `yesterday` → exit 2), `tests/unit/cost-report.bats:141` (CR-7 dry-run writes nothing; marks; byte-identical other lines; backup sha = before; receipt counts/sha256s/no row contents; report counts; idempotent second pass with `backup null` and one backup file; symlink refused with the file unchanged), `.claude/adapters/tests/test_reprice_rows.py:52` (hop row priced equal to `create_ledger_entry`, marks, input not mutated), `:78` (unresolvable row is the same object), `:87` (config / cli_reported / pre-metadata-priced rows untouched), `:99` (pre-metadata cost-0 row eligible), `:108` (idempotent), `:116` (`resolved_model` hint), `:124` (absent tokens → 0; cache tokens priced like a fresh row). Isolation: every bats case uses `--ledger` under `mktemp -d` with `LOA_RUN_DIR` redirected; `cost-report.bats` teardown asserts the repository's two ledgers are byte-identical after every case; enforcer cases never read the live ledger under bats (hermetic seams).

### No regressions in existing tests
- **Status**: ✓ Met
- **Evidence**: `tests/unit/cost-budget-enforcer-remediation.bats` + `cost-budget-enforcer-state-machine.bats` + `cost-budget-enforcer-unpriced.bats` → `1..61`, 61 ok (`scratchpad/bug245-neighbours.tap`); `cost-report.bats` 9/9 inside the 18-case run; pytest `test_reprice_rows.py` + `test_pricing_resolution_ladder.py` + `test_pricing_extended.py` + `test_cli_reported_cost.py` + `test_headless_resolved_model_metadata.py` → 87 passed. UP-1..UP-5 (the all-time shape, unavailable report, halt-100 ordering, production seam) unchanged and green; `repo-map-gen.sh --validate` consistent; `bash -n` clean on `cost-report.sh` and the enforcer lib.

### Fix addresses root cause (not just symptoms)
- **Status**: ✓ Met
- **Evidence**: the threshold (0.05) is untouched; the measurement is scoped to the object the verdict certifies (`utc_day`, `.claude/scripts/lib/cost-budget-enforcer-lib.sh:1237`) and a day that contains unpriced spend still halts (UP-7, E2E 2026-09-22); the fallback keeps the old behaviour whenever the report cannot say (`.claude/scripts/lib/cost-budget-enforcer-lib.sh:1299`); history changes only through an explicit pass that marks every row (`.claude/adapters/loa_cheval/metering/reprice.py:89`), never touches priced or unresolvable rows (`.claude/adapters/loa_cheval/metering/reprice.py:106`, `:111`), keeps a byte copy (`.claude/scripts/cost-report.sh:328`) and replaces atomically (`.claude/scripts/cost-report.sh:341`). No ledger hand-edit, no per-repository workaround.

## Technical Highlights

- **Window, not threshold.** The verdict is for one UTC day; the uncertainty that can invalidate "under budget" is that day's unpriced spend. The all-time share stays visible (`unpriced_share_all_time`) and remains the fallback when a report cannot provide a window, so an older `cost-report.sh` or a seam file in the old shape never makes the guard more permissive.
- **Prices exactly like a fresh row.** `reprice_row` uses the same `find_pricing` ladder (with the `resolved_model` hint, like `create_ledger_entry`) and `calculate_total_cost` with the row's `tokens_in` / `tokens_out` / `tokens_reasoning` / `tokens_cache_read` / `tokens_cache_creation`; `test_hop_row_is_repriced_with_marks_and_the_fresh_row_cost` pins equality with `create_ledger_entry` for the same tokens. A re-priced row is `cost_estimated: true` because it is priced after the fact at current catalog rates.
- **Byte discipline in the pass.** Only parseable lines that changed are re-serialised (`json.dumps(..., separators=(",", ":"))`, the writer's own format, original line ending kept); corrupt lines and unchanged rows are written back verbatim; the temp file is created in the ledger's directory, fsynced, mode-preserved and `os.replace`d; a failed pass unlinks the temp file and never touches the ledger. The bash guard refuses a symlink before Python runs and Python refuses again.
- **Seams stay bats-gated.** `LOA_BUDGET_COST_REPORT_SCRIPT` (new) and `LOA_BUDGET_COST_REPORT_JSON` are honoured only under the bats marker; UP-9 proves the production path ignores the stub and that it passes `--json --window-day <utc_day>`.

## Known Limitations

- A re-priced row is priced at **today's** catalog rate for the hop's **current** `extra.cli_model`; the row records that (`cost_estimated: true`, `pricing_resolution: hop`, `resolved_model`) but the true historical rate is unknowable from the row. This is the documented meaning of the pass.
- `--reprice` loads the merged config from the project root (`load_config`), so the pass prices with the catalog of the repository it runs in; there is no `--config` override (deliberately: the same catalog the writer would use).
- The window is a UTC calendar day, matching the enforcer's `utc_day`; the report's `--days` totals are unchanged and unrelated.

## Files Changed

`.claude/scripts/lib/cost-budget-enforcer-lib.sh`, `.claude/scripts/cost-report.sh`, `.claude/adapters/loa_cheval/metering/reprice.py` (new), `.claude/data/trajectory-schemas/budget-events/budget-allow.payload.schema.json`, `.claude/data/trajectory-schemas/budget-events/budget-halt-uncertainty.payload.schema.json`, `tests/unit/cost-budget-enforcer-unpriced.bats`, `tests/unit/cost-report.bats`, `.claude/adapters/tests/test_reprice_rows.py` (new), `docs/migration/v2.0-model-generation-floor.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `grimoires/loa/REPO-MAP.md` + `.checksum`, `.claude/checksums.json`, `grimoires/loa/ledger.json` (bugfix cycle registration).

## Round 2 — audit round-1 fixes (F-1 HIGH, F-2 MEDIUM, F-3 MEDIUM, F-4 LOW)

- **F-1 (writer's lock, in-place rewrite).** The file handling moved out of the heredoc into `loa_cheval.metering.reprice.reprice_ledger_file` (`.claude/adapters/loa_cheval/metering/reprice.py:172`): the ledger is opened `O_RDWR|O_NOFOLLOW`, `flock(LOCK_EX)` is taken on that fd (the same lock `append_ledger` takes, `ledger.py:229`), the bytes are read and parsed *under the lock*, and the SAME inode is rewritten with `ftruncate` + write + `fsync` — a concurrent `append_ledger` blocks and then appends after the new content; there is no orphaned inode. `--dry-run` takes `LOCK_SH` and writes nothing. Tests: `test_reprice_ledger_file.py::test_holds_the_writers_lock_and_a_later_append_survives` (the pass blocks while the test holds `LOCK_EX`; after release a real `append_ledger` row lands third), `::test_rewrites_the_same_inode_in_place_and_keeps_untouched_lines_verbatim` (inode unchanged, untouched lines byte-identical), `::test_dry_run_locks_shared_and_writes_nothing`; `tests/unit/cost-report.bats` CR-7 now asserts the inode is unchanged.
- **F-2 (no symlink following).** Backup and receipt go through `_create_exclusive` (`reprice.py:132`: `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW`, next `-N` name on `EEXIST` — a file or a symlink of any kind, dangling included), name loops use `os.path.lexists`, the receipt temp is renamed into place (`write_receipt`, `reprice.py:150`); the backup is fsynced before the in-place write starts. Test: `::test_backup_and_receipt_never_follow_a_planted_symlink` (dangling symlinks planted at the computed backup and receipt names, stamp injected: targets never appear, files land under `-2`, the plants are left alone); `::test_symlinked_ledger_is_refused_before_any_write` (`RepriceRefused`, nothing written; a missing ledger raises `FileNotFoundError`).
- **F-3 (no row-supplied authority).** `reprice_row` prices only through `find_pricing(provider, model, config)` (`reprice.py:83-86`); the `resolved_model` fallback is gone. Tests: `test_reprice_rows.py::test_resolved_model_hint_on_the_row_is_never_a_pricing_authority` (inverted from round 1) and `test_reprice_ledger_file.py::test_row_supplied_resolved_model_is_not_a_pricing_authority`.
- **F-4 (migration receipt).** `--migrate-legacy` writes its receipt through the shared `write_receipt` (`.claude/scripts/cost-report.sh` migration block), closing the class in one place; CR-3/CR-3b unchanged and green.
- **Idempotence with the new writer**: `::test_second_pass_reprices_nothing_and_makes_no_backup` — second pass: 0 re-priced, `backup null`, sha unchanged, one backup file, a second receipt under `-2`.
- **Suites after round 2**: pytest `test_reprice_rows` (7) + `test_reprice_ledger_file` (7) + ladder + extended + cli_reported → 90 passed; bats `cost-report` (9) + `cost-budget-enforcer-unpriced` (9) + `-state-machine` + `-remediation` → 70/70; `repo-map-gen.sh --validate` consistent; checksums regenerated.
- Docs: migration guide and CHANGELOG now say the pass holds the writer's lock, rewrites in place, never follows a planted path, and takes no authority from the row.

## Post-audit — Bridgebuilder pass on PR #1270

- **FIND-001 MEDIUM (fixed).** The executing stub seam `LOA_BUDGET_COST_REPORT_SCRIPT` was enabled by the bats marker alone; it now also requires `LOA_BUDGET_TEST_MODE=1` and an executable regular file (`.claude/scripts/lib/cost-budget-enforcer-lib.sh`, the double gate the L7 primitives use). UP-9 proves the marker alone leaves the stub ignored (report unavailable → allow with null) and that both gates together exercise the argv contract.
- **FIND-002 LOW (fixed).** `write_receipt` reserved nothing before renaming, so two passes in the same second could both pick the same final name. The final name is now acquired with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW` first (`-N` before the `.json` extension on collision), then the temp file is renamed over our own reservation — `test_reprice_ledger_file.py::test_receipt_name_is_reserved_exclusively_never_overwriting_a_concurrent_receipt` (a pre-existing receipt and a planted symlink at the final name are both left alone).
- **FIND-004 PRAISE** — lock + same-inode + verbatim lines kept under test.
- **CI (PR #1270, Shell Tests).** UP-9's production-path half asserted `window_day == 2026-05-04` against the real `cost-report.sh`; on CI there is no `.run/cost-ledger.jsonl`, and the missing-ledger JSON envelope omitted `window`, so the enforcer fell back to `window_day null`. Fixed in the report, not the test: the empty envelope now answers a `--window-day` question with an empty window (`{day, 0, 0, 0}`) and carries the other additive fields (`repriced_rows`, `pricing_resolution`, …), so a fresh mount is measured the same way as a populated one. CR-5 extended; a no-ledger production probe returns `window_day 2026-05-04`.
