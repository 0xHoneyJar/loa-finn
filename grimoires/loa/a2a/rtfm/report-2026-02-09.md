## Detailed Gaps

[GAP] MISSING_PREREQ
Location: Quick Start section, line 1
Problem: The documentation assumes Claude Code is already installed but never explains what it is, where to get it, or how to install it
Impact: Cannot proceed with "claude" command without knowing how to install Claude Code first
Severity: BLOCKING
Suggestion: Add a "Prerequisites" section before Quick Start that states: "Before you begin, you must have Claude Code installed. Download and install Claude Code from [URL]. Verify installation by running `claude --version`."

[GAP] MISSING_CONTEXT
Location: Quick Start section, installation command
Problem: The command says "any existing repo" but doesn't explain what this means or validate prerequisites
Impact: User doesn't know if they need a git repository initialized first, or what "existing repo" entails
Severity: BLOCKING
Suggestion: Add: "Navigate to the root directory of your existing git repository (or create a new one with `git init`), then run the following command:"

[GAP] MISSING_STEP
Location: Quick Start section, between installation and usage
Problem: No explanation of what the installation command does or how to verify it succeeded
Impact: User doesn't know if installation worked or what to check
Severity: BLOCKING
Suggestion: Add: "This command downloads the Loa framework into your repository under `.claude/` and creates configuration files. Verify installation by checking for `.claude/` directory: `ls -la .claude/`"

[GAP] MISSING_CONTEXT
Location: Quick Start section, command usage
Problem: Slash commands (`/plan`, `/build`, etc.) are shown without explaining the interface or where to type them
Impact: User doesn't know where to enter these commands
Severity: BLOCKING
Suggestion: Add: "These slash commands are entered in the Claude Code interface. After running `claude`, you'll see a prompt where you can type commands starting with `/`."

[GAP] MISSING_CONTEXT
Location: "Why 'Loa'" section
Problem: References "William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy" and "neural interfaces" as metaphor, but this is flavor text that might confuse users about what the tool actually does
Impact: Minor confusion; doesn't prevent usage but doesn't help understanding
Severity: MINOR
Suggestion: Move this section to the bottom or add a clear statement: "This is a metaphorical name. Loa is a development framework that provides structured AI-assisted coding workflows."

[GAP] MISSING_PREREQ
Location: Quick Start section
Problem: No mention of system requirements (OS, shell version, dependencies)
Impact: User on Windows or with old bash version may encounter failures
Severity: DEGRADED
Suggestion: Add: "Requirements: macOS or Linux, Bash 4.0+, git installed. For Windows, use WSL2."

[GAP] MISSING_STEP
Location: Quick Start section, after installation
Problem: No guidance on what to do after installation before running commands
Impact: User may try to run `/plan` without understanding context or setup
Severity: DEGRADED
Suggestion: Add: "After installation, restart your Claude Code session (`exit` then `claude` again) to load the Loa framework."

[GAP] ORDERING
Location: README.md structure
Problem: Quick Start appears before any explanation of prerequisites
Impact: Users jump to Quick Start and hit immediate blockers
Severity: DEGRADED
Suggestion: Reorder: 1) Prerequisites, 2) What is Loa (brief), 3) Quick Start, 4) Why Loa (detailed rationale)

[GAP] MISSING_CONTEXT
Location: Quick Start section, "Creating a project from scratch?"
Problem: References INSTALLATION.md which is not provided in this documentation set
Impact: Cannot follow the recommended path for new projects
Severity: BLOCKING
Suggestion: Either include INSTALLATION.md in the documentation set OR provide inline guidance for new projects in the README

## Tester Execution Log

### Step 1: Installation
The README.md shows:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/main/.claude/scripts/mount-loa.sh | bash
```

Attempted: Would run this command in terminal. Command syntax is clear (curl flags: -f fail silently, -s silent, -S show errors, -L follow redirects). Pipe to bash is clear.

Gap Check: Documentation says "Install (one command, any existing repo)" but doesn't specify:
- WHERE to run this command (in the root of project? anywhere?)
- WHAT "any existing repo" means (need a git repository already initialized?)
- WHAT this command actually does (download files? modify existing files? create directories?)
- IF there are prerequisites (bash required? what version? system requirements?)

### Step 2: Start Claude Code
The README shows: `claude`

Gap Check:
- WHAT is "Claude Code"? Docs reference it but never explain what it is or how to get it
- HOW do I install Claude Code before running the `claude` command?
- WHERE can I download/install Claude Code?

### Step 3: Use Golden Path Commands
The README shows 5 commands: /plan, /build, /review, /ship, /loa

Gap Check:
- WHERE do I type these commands? (in terminal? some other interface?)
- WHAT is the `/` prefix? (shell command? something else?)
- The README says "Start Claude Code" then shows slash commands but doesn't explain the interface

### Step 4: Understanding Context
The README says "Not sure where you are? `/loa` shows your current state" and references INSTALLATION.md for "Creating a project from scratch"

Gap Check:
- The README links to INSTALLATION.md but that file is NOT provided
