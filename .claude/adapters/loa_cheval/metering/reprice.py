"""Explicit, opt-in re-pricing of historical unpriced cost-ledger rows.

sprint-bug-245 (cycle-125 follow-up, bead bd-ypbg). A ledger row recorded
before the pricing ladder existed carries ``pricing_source: unknown`` and cost
0. The ladder (``find_pricing``: exact → dated → alias → hop, every rung a
config-owned mapping) can now price many of those ids; this module prices
such a row exactly as ``create_ledger_entry`` would price a fresh row with the
same tokens and marks it, so history is never rewritten silently:

    cost_micro_usd      recomputed from the row's tokens at today's catalog rates
    pricing_source      "config"
    pricing_mode        the entry's mode
    pricing_resolution  the ladder rung that matched
    resolved_model      the catalog id the rung priced (when it differs from `model`)
    cost_estimated      True — a price applied after the fact, at current rates
    repriced_at         the pass's UTC timestamp
    repriced_from       {pricing_source, cost_micro_usd} as they were

Only ``(provider, model)`` decides the price (audit F-3): a hint the row
itself carries (``resolved_model``) is never a pricing authority here — it was
written by an adapter for rows that are already priced, and a repaired row
must not be able to nominate its own catalog entry.

Rows that are already priced, rows the ladder still cannot resolve, rows with
a negative or overflowing token count (never a computed negative cost), and
rows that already carry ``repriced_at`` come back unchanged — the same object, so
the file writer can tell by identity which lines to rewrite. The input list
is never mutated.

``reprice_ledger_file`` owns the file handling (audit F-1/F-2): the ledger is
opened ``O_RDWR|O_NOFOLLOW`` and the pass holds the writer's own lock
(``flock(LOCK_EX)`` on the ledger inode, the same lock ``append_ledger``
takes) from the read to the last byte written; the file is rewritten IN
PLACE (``ftruncate`` + write + ``fsync`` on the same inode), so a concurrent
``append_ledger`` blocks and then appends after the new content instead of
landing on an orphaned inode. Untouched lines (priced rows, unresolvable rows,
corrupt lines, blank lines) are written back byte-for-byte. Before the write,
the bytes that were read are copied to ``<ledger>.pre-reprice-<stamp>``
through ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW`` (a planted file or symlink of any kind
is never followed; the next ``-N`` name is used) and fsynced — that copy is
the crash-recovery point named in the receipt. The receipt is written the
same way and renamed into place. ``cost-report.sh --reprice [--dry-run]`` is
the caller.
