## Overview

<!-- provenance: REPO-DOC-GROUNDED -->
{1-2 paragraph summary of the project. Cite PRD or SDD for claims about purpose/design.}

---

{For each category in capability-taxonomy.yaml, generate a section:}

## {Category Name}

<!-- provenance: CODE-FACTUAL -->
<!-- evidence: symbol=X, symbol=Y -->
{Describe the capability with mechanism-first language. Cite `file:line` for every factual claim. Include at least one BridgeBuilder analogy per major section.}

### {Feature Name} ({status})

<!-- provenance: CODE-FACTUAL -->
<!-- evidence: symbol=Z, literal="exact" -->
{Describe what this feature does mechanistically. Cite entry point and key implementation details.}

{If there are known limitations from limitations.yaml:}

> **Known limitation**: {description} — {reason}

---

## Design Principles

<!-- provenance: REPO-DOC-GROUNDED -->
{Describe key architectural decisions. Cite SDD or decisions.yaml.}

<!-- provenance: ANALOGY -->
{BridgeBuilder parallel explaining why these principles matter at scale.}

---

## Limitations & Honest Assessment

<!-- provenance: CODE-FACTUAL -->
{List all known limitations from limitations.yaml and TODO/FIXME extraction. Cite each.}

<!-- provenance: HYPOTHESIS -->
{Any research-stage observations. Must use epistemic markers.}

---

## What This Means

<!-- provenance: ANALOGY -->
{Closing BridgeBuilder section connecting capabilities to broader engineering context. FAANG parallels for what these capabilities enable.}
