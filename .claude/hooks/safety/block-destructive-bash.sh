# PreToolUse:Bash Safety Hook — Block Destructive Commands (v1.38.0)
# =============================================================================
# Blocks dangerous patterns and suggests safer alternatives.
# Exit 0 = allow, Exit 2 = block (stderr message fed back to agent).
#
# Cycle-111 (sprint-164, 2026-05-16) — ports Anthropic DCG public pattern
# set inline. Source: github.com/anthropics/destructive-command-guard
# Pattern port reference SHA: HEAD as of 2026-05-16 (no specific commit
# pin available — DCG ships rule packs, not single-file source).
# REVIEW-BY: 2026-08-16 — re-sync against upstream DCG every quarter.
#
# IMPORTANT: No set -euo pipefail — this hook must never fail closed.
# A grep or jq failure must result in exit 0 (allow), not an error.
#
# WHY fail-open (not fail-closed): A safety hook that crashes or encounters
# a parse error must NOT block the agent from operating. The alternative —
# fail-closed — would make jq/grep bugs into denial-of-service attacks
# against the agent. Fail-open with logging is the standard pattern for
# inline security hooks (cf. ModSecurity DetectionOnly mode).
# (Source: bridge-20260213-c011he iter-1 HIGH-1 fix)
#
# WHY GNU/BSD ERE (NOT strict POSIX): grep -P (PCRE) is a GNU extension not
# available on macOS/BSD or minimal containers. grep -E (Extended Regex)
# with `\s`, `\S`, `\b` extensions works on both GNU grep (Linux) and BSD
# grep (macOS Sonoma+). Strict-POSIX ERE (busybox without -E extensions)
# is NOT in scope per cycle-111 SDD §5.0 honest-scope decision.
# (Source: bridge-20260213-c011he iter-1 HIGH-1 fix; cycle-111 SDD §5.0)
#
# WHY single script for all patterns: NFR-5 single-file invariant. Multiple
# hooks would each read stdin, parse JSON, and run regex — multiplying
# latency per command. A single emit_block helper with sequential patterns
# is simpler and faster. (cycle-111 SDD §5/§6.)
#
# Defense-in-depth posture (cycle-111 SDD §11): this hook is a fence
# against routine destructive-command mistakes by autonomous agents, NOT
# a hardened security boundary against intentional bypass. Known accepted
# bypass classes: newline statement separators, subshell wrapping
# (`bash -c '...'`, `$(...)`), eval/base64 decode, SQL comments containing
# WHERE, jq absent from PATH. See SDD §11 for full table.
# Current executable limit examples and issue dispositions:
# docs/runbooks/hook-safety.md (#1047, #1245, #1088, #1031).
#
# cycle-125 FR-1 (2026-09-23) — precision pass against the fleet corpus
# (tests/fixtures/fence-corpus/, replayed by tests/unit/block-destructive-
# bash.bats). Relaxations, each on a positively established predicate:
# FR-2 cache/build vocabulary by last segment, bare names after a
# statement-initial `cd <temp>`, paths strictly below /tmp|/var/tmp|
# /private/tmp, `$TMPDIR/<name>` only with a real temp TMPDIR, a variable
# bound exactly once to `$(mktemp -d)`; FR-1.1 branches that are ancestors
# of main/master (offline `git merge-base`); FR-1.3 generated paths;
# FR-1.4/5/6 only when a SQL runner (psql, mysql, sqlite3, prisma, …) or an
# inline interpreter program (`python -c`, `node -e`) is in the command.
# ACCEPTED RESIDUALS (deliberately not relaxed):
#   * Remote payloads: `ssh host 'rm -rf /'`, `docker exec c rm -rf /data`,
#     `kubectl exec p -- rm -rf /` keep blocking. A scrub of quoted remote
#     payloads was withdrawn at design time (Flatline SKP-001) — the text
#     fence cannot tell a remote target from a local one, and the blast
#     radius of a remote wipe is larger, not smaller.
#   * SQL through a script FILE (`python app.py` that drops a table) was
#     never matched and still is not; inline programs are matched by text.
#   * `cd "$(mktemp -d)" && rm -rf out` (substitution as the cd target) and
#     `rm -rf "$T"` where T came from anything but a plain `$(mktemp -d)`
#     or a temp path stay blocked — bind the path first, then rm.
#   * The hook never consults its own $PWD: a project checked out under
#     /tmp still has `rm -rf src` blocked.
#   * Rebinding builtins void the once-bound-variable proof only in command
#     position (`read T`, `while read T`, `IFS= read -r T`, `command read`,
#     `eval "read T"`); `exec read`, `env … read`, `sudo read`, `nice read`
#     are NOT counted — `read` is a builtin, so those forms fail or run in a
#     child and cannot rebind the caller's variable. `notes-guard.sh read`
#     and `echo read` are arguments, never rebinds.

# perf pass-2 (2026-07-05, skill-loop): fork/exec reduction. The boolean
# `echo | grep -qE` pattern dispatches (15 spawns on every benign Bash call)
# are replaced by bash [[ =~ ]] via the _match/_match_ci helpers below, which
# preserve grep's PER-LINE match model byte-for-byte (see helper comments).
# `\b` was translated to explicit POSIX boundary classes because bash =~
# compiles with the SYSTEM regex library — glibc supports \b, BSD libc does
# NOT, and this hook commits to macOS/BSD (header above). Each translated
# pattern carries an equivalence note. Deliberately NOT converted (grep
# retained): P10 DELETE-FROM segment extraction (grep -oiE multi-match with
# original-case output is not provably reproducible in bash — no match-offset
# primitive), the FR-SZ inner write-intent tests (their `X\b[^|;&]*` shapes
# make consuming \b-translation non-isomorphic; they only run when the
# command already mentions a protected path), and all `grep -oE | head -1`
# matched-substring extractions (block path only — the hook exits 2 right
# after). Also: stdin now streams straight into the Path-A jq (no cat spawn),
# audit timestamps use printf %(...)T (no date spawn), cwd uses $PWD.
# =============================================================================
# perf pass-8 (2026-07-05, skill-loop): provably-complete literal pre-filters
# on the pattern dispatch. After pass 2 the ~95% benign path still paid 13
# sequential ERE evaluations (~0.4 ms) plus the one unconditional P10 grep
# spawn (~3 ms). Each pattern group is now guarded by a cheap bash substring
# test on literal(s) PROVABLY NECESSARY for the group to match: each guard
# literal appears in the group's regex as a mandatory concatenation element —
# outside every alternation branch, optional (?) group and starred group — so
# any MATCHING LINE must contain it verbatim, hence the whole $command must
# contain it. Absence from the whole string therefore proves no line can
# match, and the group is skipped — outcome-identical by construction.
# Where a guard uses an alternation's literals (P6 drop|clear, FR-SZ
# .run/|grimoires/loa/skills), the guard tests ALL branch literals and any
# hit evaluates the group. Guards only ever SKIP, never accept: when the
# literal is present the group evaluates exactly as before, in the original
# order (first match still wins, block messages byte-identical).
# Case-insensitive groups (P8/P9/P10) guard on the same C-locale ASCII fold
# (${command,,}) that _match_ci applies per line and grep -i applies under
# the LC_ALL=C pin — folding is per-character and leaves \n untouched, so
# the folded whole string is exactly the folded lines joined by \n, and a
# literal absent from the folded whole is absent from every folded line.
# Per-group necessity proofs sit next to each guard. The P10 DELETE-FROM
# grep — the last unconditional spawn on the benign path — now runs only
# when the folded command contains both "delete" and "from" (both mandatory
# in its -i pattern). The log-redactor stays block-path-only (verified: it
# is exec'd only inside emit_block and the FR-SZ bypass audit branch).

# perf pass-11 (skill-loop, 2026-07-06): HIGH-002 fix (BB review of PR #1176).
# Passes 2 & 8 introduced bash-4-only constructs into this fence (${x,,}
# case-folding, `mapfile`); pre-loop it was bash-3.2-portable (echo|grep -i).
# macOS ships bash 3.2. This guard runs BEFORE any bash-4 expansion executes
# (bash 3.2 defers ${,,} validation and the mapfile builtin lookup to runtime,
# so a runtime guard at the first executable line runs first and never reaches
# them). If a bash >=4 exists (the framework already requires it — beads-health
# etc. source bash-version-guard.sh), re-exec under it; stdin (the hook payload)
# and argv survive exec. Otherwise FAIL CLOSED (exit 2 = block): a
# destructive-command fence must never silently allow when it cannot evaluate.
# The generic bash-version-guard.sh exits 1, which is a NON-blocking PreToolUse
# hook error (fail-OPEN) — wrong direction for this hook, hence the inline form.

# Produce _cmd_match, a LOCAL scrub-copy of $command used SOLELY for the
# block/allow decision below. $command itself is left byte-for-byte intact so
# emit_block's audit row still records the operator's original command.
#
# The fence is quote-blind: it sees a destructive TOKEN (rm -rf, DROP/TRUNCATE
# TABLE, DELETE FROM, git branch -D, ...) inside an INERT data carrier — an
# echo argument, a git commit message, a bead description, a gh PR body — and
# blocks a harmless command. The GENERAL problem (deciding whether an arbitrary
# quoted string will be executed) is NOT tractable in a regex fence — any
# allowlist of *execution* shapes (ssh/su -c/sh -c/xargs/...) is unbounded and
# reintroduces bypass (issue #1047). This is the INVERSE: a curated allowlist
# of KNOWN-INERT data carriers, whose value we redact into the scrub-copy.
#
# The metadata content gate (cycle-120 C-D3a) leaves values containing `$(` or
# backticks INTACT, including `$$(...)`. Those expansions can execute even in
# double quotes. A lone `$` is permitted. Double-quote escapes are consumed as
# pairs so an escaped quote cannot open a fake tail flag spanning a live write.
# The command-position prefix check rejects names inside other quoted data or
# interpreter/eval arguments. Unknown contexts retain conservative matching;
# these bounded recognizers do not establish arbitrary execution semantics.
#
# Carrier values may contain literal separators; following executable segments
# remain visible, so `echo 'safe' && rm -rf /` still blocks. Word boundaries and
# the prefix check keep `notgit commit -m '…'` from matching. echo/printf stays a sed
# scrub (rest-of-segment, not a quoted value); the git/br/gh quoted-value
# carriers use the content-gated bash loop `_bdb_scrub` below (replace the value
# with a single SPACE, never empty). BSD/GNU ERE only — no \b (BSD libc lacks
# it; header §).
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bare echo/printf carrier: from a segment-start echo/printf to the end of its
# segment. The rest-class excludes ; & | (segment separators — per-segment
# scoping), $ and backtick (command-substitution — never redact past them), and
# < > (redirect operators — leave redirects + their targets intact so the FR-SZ
# State-Zone write guard, which keys off the raw path, still fires on
# `echo x >> .run/cron.d/job.sh`).

# Quoted-value carriers (git commit -m / br|bd … -d / gh … create --body|--title).
# cycle-120 C-D3a: content-gated redaction. The value permits `$` and stops at
# an unescaped closing quote; _bdb_scrub then applies the content gate. The
# quoted value is the penultimate capture group. [^;&|]* keeps
# the prefix within one segment; (^|[^[:alnum:]_]) is the anti-spoof boundary.
# cycle-120 R1 fix (CRITICAL): the pre-flag prefix classes ALSO exclude quotes
# (`[^;&|'"]*`). Without that, POSIX leftmost-longest lets the prefix walk PAST
# the real flag+opening-quote and re-anchor on a decoy flag literal embedded in
# the value (`git commit -m "-m " && rm -rf "/"`), so the value capture spans
# from the string's real closing quote to the NEXT quote — swallowing a live
# `&& rm -rf "` into a redacted "carrier value". Barring quotes from the prefix
# means a flag can only be matched before any quote in the segment is opened.
# A double-quoted value consumes backslash/character pairs together. An escaped
# quote must never become a terminator and expose a fake subsequent flag.
# The value is the penultimate group; the last group is the double-quote atom.

# FR-SZ — State-Zone executable/lifecycle write guard (sprint-bug-213 / #1044)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Blocks DIRECT inline agent writes to the executable / lifecycle-controlled
# subset of the State Zone, which the shipped Bash allow-list (cp/tee/cat/echo/
# python3/bash/sh/ln/dd/tar/sed/...) otherwise permits with no prompt:
#   - .run/cron.d           deferred-execution cron scripts (dir + descendants)
#   - .run/...*.sh          sourced for model routing (incl. merged-model-aliases.sh)
#   - grimoires/loa/skills  skill-approval lifecycle (dir + descendants)
# Companion tool-layer half: the Write/Edit deny rules in .claude/settings.json
# (deny > allow). A Write-only deny without this Bash guard is theater (#1044).
#
# SCOPE (validated): the PreToolUse:Bash hook sees only the agent's OUTER command
# string. A generator invoked as `python3 .../model-overlay-hook.py` or `bash X.sh`
# that writes these paths INTERNALLY is invisible here (the redirect lives inside an
# already-approved subprocess) — so this guard blocks only DIRECT inline writes and
# leaves the legitimate generators frictionless (recon: zero inline callers).
#
# Coverage (sprint-bug-213 iter-2, cross-model dissent CR-1..CR-5): directory
# destinations with or without a trailing slash; option-form destinations
# (-t/--target-directory for the copy family, -C/--directory for tar, -d for unzip);
# tee long-options and non-first operands; grouped/long in-place editor flags
# (-Ei, --in-place); and a trailing shell comment as a statement terminator.
#
# Accepted bypass classes (defense-in-depth fence, NOT a hardened boundary; cf. the
# header section-11 list): post-cd relative writes, variable-indirected targets,
# obfuscated interpreter writes (base64/concat path in -c), a pipe-delimited sed
# in-place edit (the statement-bound stops at the first pipe), git checkout of a
# tracked path, non-allow-listed writers (truncate/sponge/ex/ed already prompt),
# and a trailing comment that merely mentions a protected path. Sanctioned override
# for the skill-audit approve move + operator use: LOA_ALLOW_STATE_ZONE_EXEC_WRITE=1.
#
# pass-2: only the cheap OUTER gate below was converted to _match (it runs on
# every Bash call). The inner write-intent greps fire only when the command
# already mentions a protected path — left as grep because their `\btee\b…`,
# `\bdd\b…[^|;&]*` shapes do not admit a provably-isomorphic consuming \b
# translation (the boundary char can be the first char of the next element).
# pass-8 pre-filter: the outer-gate ERE is a three-branch alternation whose
# branches mandate, respectively, the literals `.run/` (from \.run/…\.sh),
# `.run/cron.d` (⊃ `.run/`), and `grimoires/loa/skills`. The guard tests the
# two distinct covering literals — either present ⇒ evaluate the gate.

# FR-2 — Context-aware rm -rf (P1 refined)
# SDD §5.1 v1.3: multi-invocation iteration + per-arg classification.
# Replaces the v1.37.0 blanket-block. Block on catastrophic paths; allow
# clearly-bounded subpaths; conservative-block on ambiguous shapes.
#
# Limitations (SDD §5.0.1 / §11):
# - `read -r -a` does NOT shell-parse quotes — paths with embedded spaces
#   get split into multiple tokens, falling into the AMBIGUOUS branch
#   (conservative block, NOT incorrect allow). Acceptable behavior.
# - The ALLOW list now EXCLUDES `./`, `./*`, `./.git`, `./.ssh`, `./.env`
#   (SKP-002 round-3 closure) — these were dangerous shapes that v1.0
#   incorrectly hit the `^\./` allow-prefix.
# - FR-2-REDIR (bd-c117-e, #1177): before segment extraction a scrub removes
#   shell `&`-redirect operators (`2>&1`/`>&2` fd-dups, `&>file`/`&>>file`)
#   from a LOCAL copy of the command, and a per-arg pre-pass below strips the
#   remaining non-`&` redirects (`2>/dev/null`, `>log`, spaced `2> /dev/null`)
#   so none are misclassified as rm operands. The scrub runs FIRST precisely
#   so an `&` cannot truncate rm_segments and hide a catastrophic operand that
#   FOLLOWS the redirect (`rm -rf 2>&1 /` — the `/` would otherwise be lost).
#   `&&` command separators survive the scrub (fd-dup needs `>` before the `&`,
#   `&>` needs `>` after), so multi-statement detection stays intact.
# - C15/cycle-119 panel amendment: `find ROOT ... -exec rm -rf {} [+|\;]`
#   shapes previously misclassified the {} / + PLACEHOLDER tokens (never real
#   paths) as ambiguous rm operands, blocking even a fully safe root (e.g.
#   `find ./build -exec rm -rf {} +`). When an rm segment's only non-flag
#   operands are find-exec placeholders AND that segment is immediately
#   preceded (same statement) by `find ROOT ... -exec`, the FIND ROOT is
#   classified through this SAME ladder instead of the placeholders. A root
#   containing `$` matches none of the ladder's branches (never a bypass —
#   see _re_find_exec_prefix below), so it always falls to AMBIGUOUS, same as
#   today: $-expansion roots are NEVER allowed. Backslash-semicolon
#   (`-exec ... {} \;`) is not covered by the ALLOW path — the segment
#   extraction below already stops at the bare `;` (pre-existing, unrelated
#   to this change), so that shape keeps its prior conservative-block
#   behavior unchanged.
#
# pass-2: gate + per-arg classification tests converted to [[ =~ ]]. The
# per-arg tests match DIRECTLY (no line loop): $unquoted derives from
# `read -r -a` word-splitting, so it can never contain a newline — a
# 1-token string IS grep's single-line input. The rm_segments grep -oE
# multi-match extraction is retained (same rationale as P10).
# pass-8 pre-filter: `rm` is a mandatory concatenation element of the gate
# ERE; every branch of its flags alternation begins with the literal `-`.
