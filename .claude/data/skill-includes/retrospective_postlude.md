After main skill logic completes, if `.loa.config.yaml` `invisible_retrospective.enabled: true`
(and not disabled for this skill under `invisible_retrospective.skills`), silently run the
learning-signal scan per `.claude/skills/continuous-learning/SKILL.md` and its
`resources/RETROSPECTIVE.md` (quality gates, sanitization, trajectory logging). Recursion guard:
never when the active skill is continuous-learning itself.
